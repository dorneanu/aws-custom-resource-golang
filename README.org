AWS custom resources using Golang, Lambda and TypeScript.

* Motivation

This is ready-to-deploy proof of concept leveraging Golang to efficiently handle the lifecycle management
of so called [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html][AWS custom resources]]. This repository exemplifies how to use these to create [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html][SSM parameters]] of type
~SecureString~ in CDK. You can, of course, use this repository as a template for more advanced custom resources.

* Deployment

Make sure you first install all dependencies:
- ~go~ binary
- ~npm~

Then clone this repository:

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dorneanu/aws-custom-resource-golang
#+end_src

Then install all ~npm~ dependencies:

#+begin_src sh
$ cd deployments
$ npm i --save-dev
added 310 packages in 3s

30 packages are looking for funding
run `npm fund` for details
#+end_src

I always recommend to first run ~cdk diff~ before deploying. This way you can review the
changes before it's to late:

#+begin_src sh
$ npx aws-cdk diff
#+end_src

Afterwards you can *deploy*:

#+begin_src sh
$ npx aws-cdk deploy
#+end_src

* TODOs
- [ ] Add [[https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus][logrus]]
- [X] Try to bundle Golang based lambda function locally first (see this [[https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-build-bundle-deploy-example/blob/main/cdk-bundle-go-lambda-example/lib/api-stack.ts][example]])
- [X] Test locally
